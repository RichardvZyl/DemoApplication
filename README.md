DemoApplication

Please note this was built over easter weekend while having family responsibilities and church services.
With more time I would be able to both improve and expand upon functionality.

I have another few projects which I can walkthrough / demo during an interview with examples of middleware, composite tables (many to many relationships), External connections and API calls, Error handling, and more.

The most impressive code coincides within the abstractions in my opinion which I would like to keep as my own intelectual property until I start a career then I will use my abstractions.

I still intend to move abstractions to nuget packages as soon as I have the time.
Once abstractions are deployed as nuget packages the program should be buildable and runnable.

PS. Cryptogrophy services are currently short circuited until I have time to address .net 6.0 breaking change:

PS. I use secrets so another reason why the program won't run. still learning how to allow access to secrets.
